      <p>Taxes are levied around the country, where the richest pay more and the poorest pay less, and this money is redistributed and used to finance the development of the poorest regions of the country.</p>
      <p>Only an absolutely inhuman person would be against that. Sure?</p>
      <p>Wrong!</p>
      <p>Economic logic is subtle and often counterintuitive, but when applied correctly it allows us to perceive the real wolves in sheep's clothing that prowl society.</p>
      <p>To destroy this doctrine and expose its logical fallacies and the parasites who live off taxes, the first task is to analyze how the taxation process works.</p>
      <p>Taxation is nothing more than expropriating society under the threat of police violence monopolized by the state. And like any system of robbery, the poorest people are most vulnerable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Poor people have their taxes deducted directly from the source and their salary known to the government.</li>
        <li>Poor people have very restricted access to credit and when they need it, they pay the highest interest rates.</li>
        <li>Poor people spend most of their wages on food, clothing, medicine, fuel and transportation, housing where the government strategically places large consumption taxes on companies that produce these kinds of goods.</li>
        <li>Poor people lose much of their family's wealth every time there is a transfer of assets because these are known and routinely taxed by the government.</li>
        <li>Poor people are always working to pay their immediate bills, which implies that there is no time to think about creating a strategy to defend the little wealth and income they have.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The situation of the richest is absolutely opposite in these aspects, and it is impossible to make the richest pay taxes equal to or more than the poorest, because the simple fact of being rich implies that they know and have the resources to better defend their assets and labor from state expropriation.</p>
      <p>The poor who know how to defend themselves from the state are not poor, they are rich or become rich.</p>
      <p>The rich who do not know how to defend themselves against the state are not rich, they are poor or they become poor.</p>
      <p>The next step is to understand the redistribution industry and who the real winners are, so that we can finally destroy this evil doctrine that haunts our lives.</p>
      <p>Not all people live on voluntary exchanges, in our society there is an entity called the state, which confiscates the wealth of the population, in theory under emotional blackmail claiming to fight poverty and everything that is evil in the world, in practice under the threat of police violence duly monopolized by this demonic institution.</p>
      <p>And for the members of the state, this process of redistribution is their source of income and has its logic extremely clear:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Taxes are levied where they are easiest to obtain, on the most vulnerable people in society.</li>
        <li>We justify this criminal practice with Robin Hood-style emotional blackmail, with the aim of reaching the hearts of the most naïve people to gain public support.</li>
        <li>This money is used to finance the entire state structure, from tax collectors, bureaucrats to public figures whose goal is to convince everyone of the moral validity of this gang of criminals.</li>
        <li>Some crumbs are effectively sent to the poorest, but always with the aim of removing the incentive of these people to work and be independent. And by permanently keeping this taxation and redistribution scheme in place.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All this analysis was necessary to realize that the federative pact is nothing more than collecting taxes from the poor in rich regions to keep the poor in poor regions always in poverty, thus being permanently valid the industry of parasites that live at the expense of the state.</p>
      <p>After dissecting the system, it is easy to see that the state is nothing more than a gang with the objective of lying and using violence against honest people to make the ills that affect the population permanent and, consequently, their income from theft and extortion.</p>
      <p>And their modus operandi is always about getting the money through the easiest way, the preference is people in vulnerable situations, abusing cruelty and cowardice in their lies, threats and effective violence against the population.</p>
