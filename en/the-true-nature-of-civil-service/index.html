      <p>The promise of stability and security attracts many young people to public service. Who wouldn't want a solid career, with flexible working hours, quality of life, financial stability and full retirement.</p>
      <p>Described this way, there is no reason for you to be part of the private sector. However, the greatest demonstration of ignorance in economics is becoming a public servant.</p>
      <p>Why? What are the real choices involved in a public career?</p>
      <p>To answer this question, the first thing we have to realize is that the state does not work like the private sector. All of its income comes from the expropriation of other people's work, it is a gang in which each person involved in this mafia has a clear role in the objective of increasing and perpetuating this expropriation. While the private sector has its revenue originating from voluntary exchanges.</p>
      <p>If this were not enough, the state spends more than it collects through the confiscation of other people's production, and imposes a legal tender through police violence on the population, thus being able to "solve" its budget deficit through inflation.</p>
      <p>With this small introduction we are in a position to understand what it means to be a public servant. What people who make this mistake neglect when making this choice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The account balance is just a numerical representation of a portion of society's wealth. While the work of the private sector builds wealth, the public sector destroys it.</li>
        <li>The inevitable inflation originating from public spending will depreciate the purchasing power of the population as a whole, but even with even more generous corrections, public servants will see their salary decrease and their full retirement not buy what they promised when they started their career, despite the "corrected" and higher numerical value.</li>
        <li>The state is an institution that, in order to exist, depends on the population not recognizing its true nature as a gang of criminals. This is reflected in its entire administrative structure, full of falsehood, corruption, groups fighting for power, constant threat of violence, covering up grotesque errors, inefficiency in delivering services.</li>
        <li>Far from a clear objective, to produce and better serve the customer, the growth metrics within the state are subjective and rigid based on years at work, risk to the careers of others, and the ability to obey without questioning. Where the people involved are forced to give up the most basic moral values for a human being in order to grow, or accept inferior positions without the slightest possibility of growth.</li>
        <li>Financial incentives and co-workers in the civil service contaminate the personal lives of those involved, giving up true friendships and the most productive years of life. The lie necessary to survive within the state makes them lonely, dependent on the state and embittered. for a life without prospects.</li>
        <li>Career stability is actually a necessity for the existence of the state itself. As this is an institution for criminals, if people are fired and stop being dependent on them, there is a real risk of increasing public reports of the atrocities that the state commits against the population, citing their own co-workers. In the extreme case of armies and special police groups, stories of dissidents who were persecuted and murdered are not uncommon. There is no former member of a criminal gang, he joined, he stays until the end.</li>
        <li>The belief that the state is invincible and that you will be forced to pay a lot of taxes in the private sector keeps people away from this path, when in reality, technology has created different ways of working independently, of not having your income known to the state, to maintain remote work groups anywhere on the planet, to learn correct ethical and moral values, and easy access to study material in any area of human knowledge.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is clear that in the best case scenario, people who choose a public career are people who have very little knowledge of economics and the possibilities of entrepreneurship and production through the use of technology, in addition to having no ambition or desire to serve their fellow human beings.</p>
      <p>And in the worst case scenario, they are demagogues, psychopaths, maniacs, and all kinds of crazy people, who fulfill themselves professionally in the public service, where being themselves represents hierarchical and financial growth.</p>
      <p>Be self-taught, entrepreneurial, keep your distance from public officials and teach what the state is in simple terms to your friends, colleagues and family. Life is too beautiful to get involved with the state.</p>
